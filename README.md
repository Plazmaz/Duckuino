Duckuino
========

An unofficial Duckyscript to Arduino converter This program was tested on an Arduino Micro,
but should work just as well on the leonardo or other models that support the keyboard library.
To run this program, simply download the repository and open "Duckuino.html" in your web browser.
Paste the duckyscript into the left box, and press "Compile". Your Arduino code will appear in the box on the right.
**Please note that I am not affiliated with Arduino or Hak5.**
Enjoy!
